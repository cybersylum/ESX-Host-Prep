# ESX-Host-Prep
a basic powershell script using PowerCLI to set some basic configurations for ESXi hosts

If you have a small environment or do not use Enterprise Plus licensing (for Host Profiles), this script can help automate some basic configurations that may be the same across a number of hosts.  It can be easily extended to add other configuration items or adjusted to meet the needs in your environment
